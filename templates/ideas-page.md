###  Idea Title 
Extend PCA Visualizer with Component-Feature Strength
#### Abstract

Provide an optional heatmap and color bar underneath the PCA visualizer (by shifting the lower axes) that shows the magnitude of each feature value to the component.

| **Intensity**                          | **Priority**              | **Involves**  | **Mentors**              |
| -------------                          | ------------              | ------------- | -----------              |
| {{ Moderate}}                          | {{ Medium}} | {{ }}       | {{ [@foo][], [@bar][] }} |

#### Technical Details
Provide an optional heatmap and color bar underneath the PCA visualizer (by shifting the lower axes) that shows the magnitude of each feature value to the component. This provides an explanation of which features are contributing the most to which component.

#### Helpful Experience

Knowledge of Python is required to complete this project.  Familiarity with machine learning and matplotlib is a plus.

#### First steps

1.)Install Yellowbrick on your machine.  Details on how to do this can be found here (https://github.com/DistrictDataLabs/yellowbrick#installing-yellowbrick).  
2.)In order to get familiar with Yellowbrick, we recommend checking out examples here (https://github.com/DistrictDataLabs/yellowbrick/blob/develop/examples/examples.ipynb).  
3.)We also have a quick start guide (https://github.com/DistrictDataLabs/yellowbrick/blob/master/docs/quickstart.rst).
4.)Please read the contributor section (http://www.scikit-yb.org/en/latest/contributing.html)

###  Idea Title 
Create Effect Plot for Linear Models 
#### Abstract

An effect plot is a visual tool that aids in interpreting linear models.

| {{ Moderate}}                          | {{ Medium}} | {{ }}       | {{ [@foo][], [@bar][] }} |

#### Technical Details
An effect plot is a visual tool that aids in interpreting linear models.  It shows the weights as a bar plot so you can see whether the impact is positive or negative and also how large the variance is.  An example of an effect plot can be found here (https://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book/limo.html#visual-parameter-interpretation).
