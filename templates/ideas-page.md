###  Idea Title 
Extend PCA Visualizer with Component-Feature Strength
#### Abstract

Provide an optional heatmap and color bar underneath the PCA visualizer (by shifting the lower axes) that shows the magnitude of each feature value to the component.

| **Intensity**                          | **Priority**              | **Involves**  | **Mentors**              |
| -------------                          | ------------              | ------------- | -----------              |
| {{ Moderate}}                          | {{ Medium}} | {{ }}       | {{ [@foo][], [@bar][] }} |

#### Technical Details
Provide an optional heatmap and color bar underneath the PCA visualizer (by shifting the lower axes) that shows the magnitude of each feature value to the component. This provides an explanation of which features are contributing the most to which component.

Long description of the project. **Should** include all technical details of the
projects like libraries involved. Please also link to relevant docs / issues / theory /
papers for your project if available.

#### Helpful Experience

Knowledge of Python is required to complete this project.  Familiarity with machine learning and matplotlib is a plus.

#### First steps

1.)Install Yellowbrick on your machine.  Details on how to do this can be found here (https://github.com/DistrictDataLabs/yellowbrick#installing-yellowbrick).  
2.)In order to get familiar with Yellowbrick, we recommend checking out examples here (https://github.com/DistrictDataLabs/yellowbrick/blob/develop/examples/examples.ipynb).  
3.)We also have a quick start guide (https://github.com/DistrictDataLabs/yellowbrick/blob/master/docs/quickstart.rst).
